WhatsApp is owned by Facebook (now Meta Platforms, Inc.), uses a variety of operating systems to run its servers and services. WhatsApp's infrastructure relies on a mixture of different operating systems, depending on the specific components and requirements of their services. Some of the operating systems are Linux and Unix-based systems. However, the specific OS versions and configurations are not publicly disclosed for security and scalability reasons


## What programming languages/frameworks are used?
WhatsApp uses multiple programming languages and frameworks to build their application. Here are some of the languages and frameworks they use:
1. Java for the Android app
2. Swift for the iOS app
3. Python for the backend infrastructure
4. Erlang for the messaging server
5. Facebook's OpenSource Buck build system
6. ReactNative for WhatsApp Business

## What storage and what database technologies are used?
1. Storage: WhatsApp uses a distributed file system, specifically the Facebook-developed Haystack, to store and serve media files like images and videos.
2. Database: WhatsApp employs a sharded MySQL database to store user information, chat metadata, and message history. They also leverage Cassandra for handling high volumes of message data. Additionally, they use HBase for data storage and processing.


## What Opensource license is the technology stack licensed under?
1. Programming languages:
Java is used for the Android app's development, allowing for platform-specific optimizations.
Swift is used for the iOS app, taking advantage of Apple's modern language features.
Python is used for the backend infrastructure, leveraging its simplicity and vast libraries for web development.
2. Framework:
ReactNative allows for sharing code between iOS and Android, making development more efficient.
3. Storage:
Haystack is a distributed file system developed by Facebook, enabling scalable storage and serving of media files.

4. Database:
Sharded MySQL provides horizontal scaling and high availability for user data and chat metadata.
Cassandra handles high volumes of message data with ease, thanks to its distributed design.
HBase is used for data storage and processing, benefiting from its column-family based architecture.

5. Open source license:
MPL-2.0 allows for the free use, modification, and distribution of WhatsApp's code, promoting open source principles.
These choices enable WhatsApp to deliver a reliable, fast, and feature-rich messaging experience to billions of users worldwide!


## What is the current stock price and what was the IPO of the company? (if traded publicly.)
The current stock price for WhatsApp's parent company Meta (META) is $394.14 per share, as of January 28, 2024. WhatsApp does not have a publicly traded stock.
